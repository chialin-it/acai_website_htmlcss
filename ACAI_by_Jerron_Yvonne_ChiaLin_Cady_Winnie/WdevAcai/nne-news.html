            <h3>Bottled birds: How callous smugglers cram cockatoos into plastic bottles to get them through customs<br />4 May 2015</h3>
            <figure class="floatleft">

                <figcaption>Birds put into plastic bottles to be smuggled through customs</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>More than 24 critically endangered cockatoos were rescued by police after being found stuffed in water bottles for illegal trade.</p>
            <p>Smugglers crammed the Yellow-crested cockatoos into empty bottles so they could get through customs at Port of Tanjung Perak in Surabaya, Indonesia.</p>
            <p> Indonesian Police discovered the birds, which can be sold for as much as £650 each, and cut them free so they could receive medical attention.</p>
            <p>The Yellow-crested cockatoo was listed as a critically endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in 2007.</p>
            <p>Around 40 per cent of birds die during the illegal smuggling process.</p>

                <p>So for every 1,000 parrots caught from the wild, 400 birds died in vain, during the poaching, transportation and trade, due to poor conditions and cruel handling</p>
                <p>
                    Most parrots are prohibited from international commercial trade unless they are captive bred or permitted by the exporting country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yellow-crested cockatoos also breed very slowly and lay eggs only once a year. They can produce only two eggs at a time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Illegal trapping continues in many areas including Rawa Aopa Watumohai National Park, Buton and Kadatua Islands, but has reportedly been reduced significantly on Sumba.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Large-scale logging and conversion of forest to agriculture across its range has exacerbated the decline, and the use of pesticides is a further potential threat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The white birds can range in size from 12 inch to about 27inch in length and present a beautiful yellow crest.
                </p>
                <p>They are found in wooded and cultivated areas of East Timor and Indonesia's islands of Sulawesi and the Lesser Sundas.</p>
