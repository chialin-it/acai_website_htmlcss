            <h3>Why The Animals?</h3>
            <img class="floatleft" src="saveAnimals.jpg" alt="Save Animals" width="300" height="225" />
            <p>Animals are just like human-beings. They have biological needs and can experience pain, stress and discomfort. Most animals are intelligent and able to feel complex emotions such as joy, happiness, depression as well as distress. Studies have shown that they have family bonds and feel true compassion for each other. But what they can't do is speak for themselves. So humans feel justified in treating them as mere objects. This is the reason why this organisation chose to protect these innocent animals.</p>
            <p>By pretending that the animals don't suffer, that they can't feel pain and that they have no real need or desire for freedom, it is easier for people to use them purely as commodities and ignore their sufferings.</p>
            <p>Every year, billions of them are either captured, imprisoned, neglected, abused or slaughtered for human ends. They are used for everything from entertainment and sports to consumer product testings and food.</p>
            <p>If animals don't have a say in their treatment, then it is up to all caring human beings to give them a voice, speak up on their behalf and end their abuse.</p>
